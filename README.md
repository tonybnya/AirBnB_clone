# AirBnB Clone - The console

This project is to create a console to access and manipulate data for the AirBnB clone website, to build further.

This console is a single-used function, a command line interface from which devs can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) objects in file storage.

It is a testing tool, a sandbox where devs can play around with ideas, to see what does and doesn't work in the file storage, before building out the rest of the web application.
